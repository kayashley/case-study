        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            myFlix is a web app, developed using the MERN stack, 
            that provides users with access to information to a small variety of movies. 
            Users are able to create an account, update their personal data, 
            and create a list of their favorite movies. 
        </p>
        <h4>Purpose & Context</h4>
        <p>
            myFlix was a personal project I built as part of my web development course 
            at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my mastery of full-stack JavaScript development.
        </p>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>
            The purpose of this project was to have an ambitious full-stack project I can 
            add to my professional portfolio. The main issue I wanted to solve was to build 
            a complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <h4>Server-Side</h4>
        <p>
            By creating a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational 
            database (MongoDB). The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. 
            To retrieve data from and store data in the database, CRUD methods are used. The API 
            provides movie information in JSON format. 
        </p>
        <h4>Client-Side</h4>
        <p>
            Once I completed the API, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests 
            to, and receiving responses from the server-side. It is a single-page, responsive application, 
            developed with React and React-Redux. The application provides several interfaces, including 
            a main view (full list of movies), individual movie view (data about a single movie and allows 
            users to add the movie to their list of favorites), a login view, a registration view, and a profile 
            view (users can update their user data and list of favorite movies).

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                This project was my most favorable and most challenging project. I enjoyed building the API and 
                working with database structures. I also quickly became familiar with using the terminal. Determining 
                the client-side, it took me a while to understand how React and Redux work and how to achieve the 
                desired results. But with the help of my amazing tutor and mentor calls, I was able to successfully conquer 
                these challenges.
            </p>
        <h4>Duration</h4>
        <p>
            The development of the client-side took me twice as long as it normally took to complete a CareerFoundry achievement. 
            Bearing in mind I needed time to change gears and grasp React and React-Redux to fully understand this library.
